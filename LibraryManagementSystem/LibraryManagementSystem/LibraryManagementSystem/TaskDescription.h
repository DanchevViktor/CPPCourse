Implementing a Library Management System

Task Description :

	Create a C++ program for a simple library management system.
	The program should include classes for books and library members, and demonstrate the use of objects, methods, and pointers.

Requirements :
	Book Class :
• Attributes : title(string), auchor(string), ISBN(string).

	• Methods :
• A constructor that initializes the book details.
• display() to output the book details to the console.
	
	Member Class :
• Attributes : name(string), age(int), memberID(string).
• Methods :
• A constructor to initialize member details.
• dispiay() to output member details.
• borrOwBoox(Book * book) to simulate borrowing a book, which takes a pointer to a Book object.
	
	Main Function :
: Demonstrate te too i pread by haro ment elborow a book.
Use pointers to refer to and manipulate the book and member objects.
	
	Task Instructions :

• Implement the classes as described above.
• In the main function, create at least two book objects and two Member objects.

Demonstrate the functionality of borrowbook () method by having members borrow books.
• Make sure to use pointers appropriately when implementing the borrowBook method and handling objects in main.
